# pixel_cloud_game

Deploys to https://pixel-cloud.adno.page/

A game I had in my head since university. Written in Rust for practice.

Runnable locally, but supports WASM compilation so it runs in the browser.

Drag & drop an image and it will get shuffled into a cloud of pixels. Rotate the cloud until the original image is revealed. Best to keep images small (think game sprites).
